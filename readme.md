## Build and Installation
Lightpad has three executables: _main_, _midiprobe_, and _midiout_.  _Main_ is just what it sounds like, it's the main application, bringing together all of it's features.  _Midiprobe_ and _midiout_ focus specifically on MIDI connectivity, with the first providing a list of available MIDI I/O ports, and the second playing a test file to the Launchpad, while also telling a pressed button to pulse a random color.

```bash
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. && make -j4
../bin/lightpad[.exe]
../bin/midiprobe[.exe]
../bin/midiout[.exe]
```
