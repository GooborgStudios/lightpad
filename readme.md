## Build and Installation
Lightpad has three make projects: _main_, _midiprobe_, and _midiout_.  _Main_ is just what it sounds like, it's the main application, bringing together all of it's features.  _Midiprobe_ and _midiout_ focus specifically on MIDI connectivity, with the first providing a list of available MIDI I/O ports, and the second playing a test file to the Launchpad, while also telling a pressed button to pulse a random color.

**Main**

```bash
make [lightpad]
./lightpad
```

**MidiProbe**

```bash
make midiprobe
./midiprobe
```

**MidiOut**

```bash
make midiout
./midiout
```
