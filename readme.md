# This software is in early development and is not ready for use.  Please check back later!

## Build and Installation
Lightpad has three executables: _main_, _midiprobe_, and _midiout_.  _Main_ is just what it sounds like, it's the main application, bringing together all of it's features.  _Midiprobe_ and _midiout_ focus specifically on MIDI connectivity, with the first providing a list of available MIDI I/O ports, and the second playing a test file to the Launchpad, while also telling a pressed button to pulse a random color.

```bash
cd [lightpad directory path]
cmake . && make -j4
./bin/lightpad[.exe]
./bin/midiprobe[.exe]
./bin/midiout[.exe]
```
